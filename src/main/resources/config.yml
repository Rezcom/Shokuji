# Each Food item is of the format:
#
# food: <- Put all food items under this
#
#   CHICKEN: <- Use Spigot internal food name, all caps.
#     restore: 2 <- How much Hunger a food restores.
#     saturation: 0.7 <- Double of how much saturation it restores.
#     description: <- Description of what each food does.

#     If you don't want the food to have any effects, you still need to write "effects:", but you can
#     leave it blank.
#
#     effects: <- Each food can have MULTIPLE probability rolls.
#
#       A probability roll is a list of probabilities of effects. Whenever a food is eaten, the player receives ONE EFFECT
#       FROM EACH probability roll. If the probabilities don't add up to 1.0, then there is a probability the player
#       receives NO EFFECT from the roll. If they add up to more than 1.0, the food wont register.
#
#       custom_roll1: <- Name of probability roll. You can name this whatever you want.
#         chickHeal: <-  Probability for A SINGLE effect. Name whatever you want.
#           effect: HEAL <- Use Spigot naming convention for effect, in all caps.
#           duration: 1 <- Duration in MINECRAFT TICKS of the effect. If set to -1, eating the food REMOVES the effect instead.
#           amplifier: 0 <- How strong the effect is, starting at 0. Meaning, 0 is level ONE effect, 1 is level TWO effect, etc.
#           probability: 0.5 <- Probability of this particular effect getting rolled from THIS probability roll.
#         chickPoison:
#           effect: POISON
#           duration: 100

#
# When eating a raw chicken, players will restore 2 hunger and 0.7 saturation.
# They will have a 50% chance to get Instant Heal, but a 50% chance to get Poison for 5 seconds instead.
#
# Additionally, on top of the previous probabilities, they will have a 20% chance to get speed for 6 seconds,
# but a 30% chance to get blindness for 10 seconds. The remaining 50% is chance for neither of these to happen.
# When set to true, any player with the effect Speed of amplifier -1 will have sprinting negated to a crawl.
